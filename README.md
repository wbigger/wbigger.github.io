Here you can find my school projects and open-source courses about computer science and IT. You are welcome to study, modify and share these works!

Primary target of these courses are students of Italian technical institute, computer science and telecommunications orientation; however, I hope they can be useful also for all the CS/IT students.

## School's official page on GitHub
Here the official organization page of my school on GitHub: [IIS G. Marconi Civitavecchia](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia). This organization is also connected with GitHub Classroom.

## Research projects
As teacher, I am following some research project with students and other teachers of my school:
- [School of Athens VR](http://the-school-of-athens-vr.com/), an experience in VR that recreate the fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, using Blender, Unreal and Meta Quest 2
- [Stazione di Monitoraggio Ambientale](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19FdwQ868bjMo-5VYCzMeDcI56YT5ZGMe/view?usp=drive_link), a weather station using ESP32, LoraWAN, MicroPython, Node-RED, MongoDB Atlas, MQTT, a web page and an experience in VR visualizing the air condition written in Blender, Unity and using VRChat.
- [Easy Talk](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia/easy-talk), a technology to facilitate learning of social skills to help people with communication difficulties. Uses MS Azure Face API, Angular and Node.js.
- [Domotics & VR](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia/m4m-domotics), a prototype of a real home automation system, including electrical system, electronics, firmware, web server and a 3D environment that communicate in real time with the real environment. We used Node-RED, MQTT, Unity, Blender, Oculus Rift, Sonoff, ACME CM3. 

## Student projects
A list of projects developed with the following courses are listed [here](./orgs.md).

## Teacher Test Suite
To support the student assessments, I created a [test suite](https://github.com/wbigger/teacher-test-suite) with the following objectives:
- support multiple choice questions and open answers questions with evaluation grid
- propose tips to create good multiple answers
- easy to print, to match the needs of the Italian school
- create a different test for each student of the class, according to the student needs
- support specific learning disabilities, removing questions according to student disability or extending the maximum time
- create a profile of the student with strengths and weaknesses, to help the teacher developing effective strategies both for students and for the whole class
- provide statistics both for single questions and students, with tips for the teacher to improve the future classwork

Below is a list of the material I wrote for my courses. I hope they can help other teachers. Feel free to use them as you want for what I created, and I specified attribution for images and other stuff that are not created by me.

There is a different version per year of the same subject. This is because every year, every class is different, and the material wrote one year ago for a class is not suitable for another class this year. Of course, many pages overlap.

Please consider that all courses are in Italian language.

Courses are created with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook), a nice static site generator written in Rust (a language that i really love ❤️).

### Forth year
#### Computer Systems and Networking
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-4y-networks/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-4y-networks/)

Here we talk about ISO/OSI level 2, 3 and 4. We try to understand how the networks and routing fundamentals using a historical approach.

### Fifth year

## Other courses
### HTML5

Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-html5/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-html5/)

How to implement and deploy effectively a web page? starting from the visual artifact of our web page, we go through HTML cutting and implementation, CSS styling and creating and querying a REST API with JavaScript. Finally, we deploy our web page on the cloud with AWS services. Special attention is paid to the history of the web, to better understand the present trends.
